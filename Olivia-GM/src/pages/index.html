  <h3> Starting the Day </h3>
<p>Today is a big day for Olivia. It’s 6am and she’s already
on the road headed to Detroit for a day-long offsite
company training. A few miles in, she’s up for a quick
breakfast. “Can you find the best diner on the route,
maximum 20 miles from here?” “I found a place 12 miles
away. It’s all booked.” “Thanks.”</p>

  <h3> Planning the Day </h3>
<p>Not long after finishing her breakfast, Olivia gets an
audio note. “You’ve just received a calendar invite from
Anna Dean, 9 to 10am tomorrow. According to your
calendar, you are available. Shall I accept?” “Umm… Yes.
Accept and add ‘Looking forward to the meeting.”</p>

  <h3> Heading Home </h3>
<p>6pm, Olivia is finally headed home. Today was draining
for Olivia; she looks exhausted. “Olivia, it seems like you
had a long and stressful day. Shall I book your favourite
yoga class tomorrow and make space in your calendar
for meditation?” “Yes, that’d be great.”</p>

  <h3> Bedtime from the road </h3>
<p>“Olivia, it’s 8pm, bedtime for Clara. Do you want me to
connect to her room so you can say good night?”
“Absolutely, please.” Olivia's vehicle turns on assist mode
so she can interact with her daughter from the HD
windshield display. “Good night sweetie, I love you and
see you tomorrow morning.”</p>
